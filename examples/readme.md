# About
This directory replaces the default examples for the Arduino IDE. These sketches are referenced from the Wiki Exercise Guides. 

Please see the *PiBotFile.sh* install script in the Pioneer **Config** directory. This will replace and update the IDE's example files automattically. 

An overview and explanation of the PiBot Examples folder can be found on the *wiki* [here](https://github.com/pi-bot/pioneers/wiki/Examples-and-Libraries-Overview)
