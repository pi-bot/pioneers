/*
  Dimmer

  Demonstrates sending data from the computer to the Arduino board, in this case
  to control the brightness of an LED. The data is sent in individual bytes,
  each of which ranges from 0 to 255. Arduino reads these bytes and uses them to
  set the brightness of the LED.

  The circuit:
  - LED attached from digital pin 9 to ground.
  - Serial connection to Processing, Max/MSP, or another serial application

const int ledPin = 9;      // the pin that the LED is attached to

void setup() {
  // initialize the serial communication:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  // initialize the ledPin as an output:
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  byte brightness;

  // check if data has been sent from the computer:
  if (Serial.available()) {
    // read the most recent byte (which will be from 0 to 255):
    brightness = Serial.read();
    // set the brightness of the LED:
    analogWrite(ledPin, brightness);
  }
