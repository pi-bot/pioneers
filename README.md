# PiBot Pioneers
Welcome to the online PiBot Pioneers repository! This is the home for the initial code and getting started guides for the PiBot build-your-own robot.  

Currently the getting started guide is being deleloped in the https://github.com/pi-bot/pioneers/wiki

## Programming overview
As the getting started guide will show there are two ways of coding with the Pibot:

-  Either the PiBots on-board microcontroller directly using C++ via the on-board Arduino IDE. 
-  Or using python at a higher level. As well as using python to control the PiBots native Raspberry Pi connections (such as the camera and servos) a default Python API is provided that makes it possible to link and abstract commands to the lower level microcontroller. 

WORK IN PROGRESS 


Check back soon for progress.
