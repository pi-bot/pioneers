# Getting Started

Each Pioneer has been given a breadboard and a few components to begin learning about 


## Step 1: Let there be light
This exercise requires connecting V+ (indicated by a (+) on the top right pin-out) to the top row of the breadboard.  The breadboard is designed to make electrical physical connections without the need of solder.  See the above image for how it is constructed.  Notice that the conductive strips of the breadboard repeat in vertical columns and that there is also an electrical break between the top of the breadboard and the bottom.  Each point of the breadboard can be addressed with the top rows being assigned the letter 'A' and rows descending through the alphabet all the way through to the last row represented by  'J'.  The columns are addressed from '1' on the far left all the way to '17'on the far right.  Our first circuit  then has the following 
 connections:

- red wire connected from V+ (marked +) to the top-left 'A1' node of the breadboard.  
- a resistor connected from node B1 to B5. 
- an Led connected from C5 to C6 
- a black wire connected from D5 to F8 
- Finally a wire connected from J8 to the Gnd Pin.

The V+ is the power supply pin for our circuit and if measured will be at a regulated 3.3V.  
The circuit[ground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_(electricity)) marked **GND** completes the return path for the electric current and has a reference point of 0V.
